    \item[Finite Field] A \textbf{finite field}, denoted $\mathbb{F}_q$, is a 
        finite set of $q$ elements that comes with addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
        and division operations satisfying standard arithmetic rules (associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identities, and inverses).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A common example is the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of integers modulo a prime number $p$.
        \item The size $q$ of any finite field must be a prime power, i.e., $q = p^r$ for some prime $p$ and integer $r \ge 1$.
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Vector Space over $\mathbb{F}_q$] The set of all $n$-tuples of elements from $\mathbb{F}_q$ is denoted $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. This forms a vector space where vector addition and scalar multiplication are performed component-wise over $\mathbb{F}_q$.

    \item[Linear Subspace] A subset $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n$ is a \textbf{linear subspace} if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. That is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For any $\vec{c}_1, \vec{c}_2 \in C$, their sum $\vec{c}_1 + \vec{c}_2$ is also in $C$.
        \item For any $\vec{c} \in C$ and any scalar $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_q$, the product $\alpha\vec{c}$ is also in $C$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
\begin{description}
    \item[Linear Code] A \textbf{linear code} $C$ is a linear subspace of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. $[n, k, d]$ code 

    \item[Generator Matrix ($G$)] An $[n, k]$ linear code $C$ can be described as the row span of a $k \times n$ matrix $G$ whose rows are linearly independent.
    \[
        C = \{ \vec{m}G \mid \vec{m} \in \mathbb{F}_q^k \}
    \]
    \item[Parity-Check Matrix ($H$)] An $[n, k]$ linear code $C$ can also be described as the null space of an $(n-k) \times n$ matrix $H$ of full rank.
    \[
        C = \{ \vec{c} \in \mathbb{F}_q^n \mid H\vec{c}^T = \vec{0} \}
    \]
    For any generator matrix $G$ and parity-check matrix $H$ for the same code, it holds that $GH^T = \mathbf{0}$.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Hamming Weight] The \textbf{Hamming weight} of a vector $\vec{c}$, denoted $wt(\vec{c})$, is the number of non-zero components in $\vec{c}$. $wt(\vec{c}) = \triangle(\vec{c}, \vec{0})$.
\end{description}

\begin{theorem}
    The minimum distance $d$ of a non-trivial linear code $C$ is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of any non-zero codeword in $C$.
    \[
        d = \min_{\vec{c} \in C, \vec{c} \neq \vec{0}} wt(\vec{c})
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Subtract two codewords, that codeword will be distance $d$ of $\vec{0}$ 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    The minimum distance $d$ of a linear code $C$ with parity-check matrix $H$ is the smallest integer $d$ such that there exist $d$ linearly dependent columns in $H$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    basically there are n columsn in H that are dependent. By def there are $a_1, ..., a_n$ scalars that make it zero this is code word. The other direction is similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{description}
    \item[Dual Code] For an $[n, k]$ linear code $C$, its \textbf{dual code}, denoted $C^\perp$, is the set of all vectors in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ that are orthogonal to every codeword in $C$.
    \[
        C^\perp = \{ \vec{v} \in \mathbb{F}_q^n \mid \vec{v} \cdot \vec{c} = 0 \text{ for all } \vec{c} \in C \}
    \]
    If $C$ has generator matrix $G$ and parity-check matrix $H$, then $C^\perp$ is an $[n, n-k]$ code with generator matrix $H$ and parity-check matrix $G$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Families of Codes \& Asymptotics}

    A key goal in coding theory is to find families of codes that have both a high rate ($R=k/n$) and a high relative distance ($\delta=d/n$) as the block length $n$ goes to infinity. We seek families of $[n_i, k_i, d_i]_q$ codes where $n_i \to \infty$ and the ratios $R_i = k_i/n_i$ and $\delta_i = d_i/n_i$ approach desirable limits.

\begin{description}
    \item[Hamming Code] For any integer $r \ge 2$, the binary \textbf{Hamming code} $\text{Ham}(r, 2)$ is a code with parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Block length: $n = 2^r - 1$
        \item Dimension: $k = 2^r - 1 - r$
        \item Minimum distance: $d = 3$
    \end{itemize}
    The parity-check matrix $H$ for this code is an $r \times (2^r-1)$ matrix whose columns consist of all non-zero binary vectors of length $r$. Since any two columns are distinct and non-zero, no two columns are linearly dependent, but many sets of three columns are (e.g., if $\vec{h}_i + \vec{h}_j = \vec{h}_k$), so the distance is exactly 3.

    \item[Decoding Hamming Codes] Hamming codes have a very efficient decoding algorithm. Given a received vector $\vec{y}$, we compute the \textbf{syndrome} $\vec{s} = H\vec{y}^T$.
